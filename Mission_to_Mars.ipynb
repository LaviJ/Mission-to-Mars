This means that this element holds all of the other elements within it, and we'll reference it when we want to filter search results even further. The . is used for selecting classes, such as list_text, so the code 'div.list_text' pinpoints the <div /> tag with the class of list_text. CSS works from right to left, such as returning the last item on the list instead of the first. Because of this, when using select_one, the first matching element returned will be a <li /> element with a class of slide and all nested elements within it.\n",
